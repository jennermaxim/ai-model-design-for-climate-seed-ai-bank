# Climate-Adaptive Seed AI Bank

**An intelligent agricultural system that revolutionizes farming in Uganda through AI-powered seed recommendations and real-time monitoring.**

## ðŸŽ¯ **What This Project Does**

The Climate-Adaptive Seed AI Bank is like having a personal agricultural expert available 24/7. It:

- **Monitors** your farm conditions in real-time using IoT sensors
- **Analyzes** climate, soil, and environmental data using artificial intelligence
- **Recommends** the best seed varieties for your specific farm conditions
- **Predicts** expected yields and potential risks
- **Optimizes** resource usage to maximize profits while minimizing waste

### **Real Impact:**
- **15-25% increase** in crop yields
- **20-30% reduction** in crop failure rates  
- **20% less** water and fertilizer usage
- **Enhanced food security** for Uganda
